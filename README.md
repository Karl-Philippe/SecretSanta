# Secret Santa Gift Exchange Project

## Overview

This project is a Python-based Secret Santa gift exchange organizer. It assigns participants to gift recipients randomly while adhering to constraints such as limiting intra-family assignments. Additionally, it generates personalized HTML instruction files for each participant.

---

## Features

- **Participant Management**: Supports defining participants with names, families, and genders.
- **Custom Constraints**: Limits the number of intra-family assignments.
- **Randomized Assignments**: Ensures fair and random gift exchange assignments.
- **Validation**: Checks for duplicate assignments, self-assignments, and invalid assignments.
- **HTML Generation**: Creates personalized HTML instruction files for participants.
- **Reusable Components**: Includes utility functions for file handling and data encoding.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- A template HTML file (`instruction_template.html`) for personalized instructions.
- An optional mosaic image (`mosaic.jpeg`) to be embedded in the HTML files (or any other seamless pattern).

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secret-santa.git
   cd secret-santa
   ```

---

## Usage

### Define Participants

Participants are now loaded from the `participants.json` file:

`participants.json` example:
```json
[
    {"name": "John", "family": "Family A", "gender": "male"},
    {"name": "Jane", "family": "Family A", "gender": "female"},
    {"name": "Jim", "family": "Family B", "gender": "male"}
]
```

### Run the Program

1. Set the maximum budget for gifts in the script:

   ```python
   max_budget = 40  # Change as needed
   ```

2. Define the output directory:

   ```python
   directory = f"Échange_cadeau_{date.today().year}"
   ```

3. Execute the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. The HTML files will be saved in the specified directory.

---

## Configuration

- **Max Budget**: Change `max_budget` to adjust the gift limit.
- **Max Intra-Family Assignments**: Modify `max_intra_family` to allow more intra-family gift exchanges.

## Error Handling

If the script cannot generate valid assignments after multiple attempts, it will raise an exception:

```bash
Erreur: Impossible de générer une attribution valide après plusieurs tentatives.
```
